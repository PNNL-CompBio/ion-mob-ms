User Interface - Functional.

This is being built in Python3.9 with the Ktinker front-end library.

In progress: simplify and make code more scalable / easy to modify. Still a couple bugs that are being worked on.  If the user is not trying to break it, it works.


Current roadblocks - need list of static parameters, dynamic parameters, and required file uploads for each experiment type.
                   - need format of "nexflow run" command. I'll use string substitution to call arguments in a order specifed on back-end.
