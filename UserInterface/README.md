User Interface

This is being built in Python3.9 with the Ktinker front-end library.

In progress: simplfy and compress code. Reduce lengthy hard-coded sections. Then re-design stepped field and SLIM sections.

Current roadblock - need list of static parameters, dynamic parameters, and required file uploads for each experiment type.
