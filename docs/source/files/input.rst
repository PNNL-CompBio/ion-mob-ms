File Preparation
===================

Examples of each data type can be found under `test
data <https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/ion-mob-ms/tree/main/test-data>`__
in the `github
repository <https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/ion-mob-ms/>`__.

PreProcessed Data Folder 
-------------------------------
| Raw data is generated by vendor instruments. This data is commonly
  encoded in a propriatory format. It is recommended to first process this data with `PNNL PreProcessor <https://pnnl-comp-mass-spec.github.io/PNNL-PreProcessor>`_. All raw/Preprocessed data must be together in an
  encompassing folder, some raw data types such as Agilent (.d) are
  folders themselves, these must still be isolated in an encompassing
  folder. See more details in section titled “Upload your files” below.
  Supported file types can be found on the `proteowizard
  website <https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/doc_users.html>`__.  
  
IMS Metadata Folder 
-------------------------------
| This data is generated alongside and paired with the raw data by some
  vendors. It includes information such as instrument specifications,
  temperature deviations between runs, and electrical current changes.
  This is required for stepped field experiments and optional for single
  field experiments. Including this data for single field experiments
  improves accuracy of CCS value predictions.  
  
Feature Data Folder    
-------------------------------
| Feature files are generated by Mzmine or DEIMoS. Features, also known
  as peaks, are predicted based on signal-to-noise ratio of drift time,
  intensity, and mass/charge (m/z) ratios.   
 
Target List File 
--------------------------
| This excel file is required for stepped field experiments. This
  contains the following columns: CompoundID, CompoundName, ExactMass, UniqueID4RawFileNames, Adduct_mz, Ionization, ExpectedCCS.
| This must be created by the user with known molecules/standards and
  neutral masses in order to compare with sample data and calculate CCS
  values. Singlefield Target List File can be generated from the SteppedField CCS table output using this `script <https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/ion-mob-ms/blob/main/Post-hoc-scripts/Target_file_list_creator.Rmd>`__.  
  
Metadata File  
----------------------
| This hidden metadata file is generated from PreProcessed data and
  includes the following metrics: RawFileName, AcquiredTime,
  InstrumentName, IonPolarity, Well, Cartridge. This is generated in and
  required for the AutoCCS step.  
  
Calibrant File
-------------------------
| This text file includes calibrant information for single field
  experiments. Calibrant information includes: CCS values, mass(m),
  charge(z), m/z, and ionization.
