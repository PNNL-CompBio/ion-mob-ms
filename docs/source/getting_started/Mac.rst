Mac Graphical User Interface
==============
The Ion Mobility Dashboard was originally tested and developed on an 
intel-based (x86 architecture) Mac. 
Limited development has been performed on an M1 Mac due to an unsupported 
Proteowizard (MSconvert) docker image. 
New versions of Docker Desktop may eventually be able to emulate the x86 
architecture on M1 but this has not been seen yet.


Installation
==============

Two applications are required to run workflows: Docker Desktop, and 
Ion_Mob_MacOS (note to dev: this needs to be rebuilt).

| **Mac Installation**:
| 1. Download
  `Ion_Mob_MacOS.zip <https://zenodo.org/record/6941767#.YuRxcuzMIXA>`__.
  Ensure this is version 1.1, or “DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6941767”. 
| 2. Download `Docker Desktop for Mac 
<https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/>`__.
| 3. Restart computer if prompted with Docker Desktop.
| 4. Open Docker Desktop then Ion_Mob_MacOS.
| **Note** Docker Desktop must be open before Ion_Mob_MacOS is started.
