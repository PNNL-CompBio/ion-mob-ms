The Ion Mobility Mass Spec Dashboard is designed to allow scientists to process their own Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry raw data without requiring a third-party computer scientist or bioinformatician. This dashboard joins four sequential command line tools into a single user-friendly application. These tools are nessesary for performing quality control data processing, file type conversion (from proprietary to an open-source format), detect unique features, and calculate collision-Cross section values required for identifying and differentiating small molecules.

## How to install  
  
Two applications are required to run workflows: Docker Desktop, and UI_V2. 
  
**Mac Installation**:  
1. Download UI_V2  
2. Download [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)  
3. Restart computer if prompted  
4. Open Docker Desktop and then UI_V2 
  
**Windows Installation**:  
1. Download [Ion_Mob_PC.exe](https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/ion-mob-ms/blob/main/UserInterfaceV2/Ion_Mob_PC.exe)  
2. Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)    
3. Install WSL2 via PowerShell. Open "Powershell" as an **Administrator**, then type the command "wsl --install -d ubuntu"

## Prepare to run
You will need a series of files/folder to start, depending on the workflow you want to run. A brief description of how to identify each file type is below. Examples of each data type can be found in the [github repository](https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/ion-mob-ms/).
  
**Raw Data Folder**  
Raw data is generated by vendor instruments. This data is commonly encoded in a propriatory format. All raw data must be together in an encompassing folder, some raw data types such as Agilent (.d) are folders themselves, these must still be isolated in an encompassing folder. See more details in section titled "Upload your files" below. Supported file types can be found [here](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/doc_users.html).    
    
 **IMS Metadata Folder**   
This data is generated alongside and paired with the raw data by some vendors. It includes information such as instrument specifications, temperature deviations between runs, and electrical current changes. This is required for stepped field experiments and optional for single field experiments. Including this data for single field experiments improves accuracy of CCS value predictions.  
   
**Feature Data Folder**  
Feature files are generated by Mzmine or DEIMoS. Features, also known as peaks, are predicted based on signal-to-noise ratio of drift time, intensity, and mass/charge (m/z) ratios.  
  
**Target List File**  
This excel file is required for stepped field experiments. This contains four columns: compound name, compound ID, exact mass, unique ID4D file names.  
This must be created by the user with known molecules/standards and neutral masses in order to compare with sample data and calculate CCS values.
  
**Metadata File**  
This metadata files includes the following data for each sample: RawFileName, AcquiredTime, InstrumentName, IonPolarity, Well, Cartridge. This is generated for agilent data after PNNL PreProcessor. **How is this generated othwerwise...?**  

  
**Calibrant File**  
This text file includes calibrant information for single field experiments. Calibrant information includes: CCS values, mass(m), charge(z), m/z, and ionization.    
  
## Select your Workflow  
  
There are generally three types of workflows to run:  
  
### DTIMS Single field  
Drift tube ion mobility mass spectrometry requires knowledge of experiments and a table of calibration ions.
  
### SLIM data (also single field)
Data from the SLIM machine.
  
### DTIMS Stepped field
Drift tube ion mobility mass spectrometry that requires specific known targets and their masses.
Each mode has separate needs for input files, but runs a combination of the modules depicted below.
  
### Single Tool Option 
This option is selected to run tools individually.
  
## Select your Tool 
  
Select which tool you would like to run. Grey boxes are unavailable, white boxes are available, and the orange box indicates which is selected.
 
<img src="Dashboard_Tool_Select_Image.png" width="800"> 
  
If AutoCCS is selected, choose single field, stepped field, or SLIM depending on your experiment.  
  
<img src="Dashboard_Experiment_Select_Image.png" width="800">   
  
## Upload your files  
  
To upload files/folders, please sort each file type into their own folder, then select the folder by clicking "Browse".  
For example, all Raw data files should be placed in a single folder without any other files. This includes data types such as Agilent (.d) which are folders themselves - ie: select the encompassing folder/directory which holds one or more raw data types, not the data files themselves.  
  
<img src="File_Select_Image.PNG" width="800">   
  
While browsing, any "Folder" upload will hide all individual files to avoid improper selections.  
 
Individual File uploads do not require folders and may be selected directly. These include: Calibrant File, Target List File, and Metadata File.  
  
Once files are uploaded, select the Run tab.

## Run Experiment  
  
Prior to selecting "Run Experiment", Docker must be open. Docker is required to run each of the tools.  
  
 <img src="Docker_Image.png" width="800"> 
  
Please confirm all variables and path locations before running experiment.  

<img src="Dashboard_Run_Button_Image.png" width="800"> 
  
When running experiment, do not exit the application or Docker. Doing so may result in temporary files (such as .tar files in data folders) not being deleted. 
If exited early, please ensure no temporary files exist in experimental folders before running again.  
  
## Viewing and Saving Results  
  
  
After an experiment is completed, a "Save Results" button should appear. Select this button to find a folder to save results at.

If CCS Values were generated, a summary graph or PDF will be available to preview depending on the experiment type.  
  
  
## Running Additional Experiments  
 
To clear all parameters and results, select the "Clear Experiment" button and confirm. Save results before clearing or they will be lost.

## Errors and Troubleshooting  
  
**Docker Errors**  
Connectivity issues between Docker Desktop and UI_V2 may lead to issues with experiments completing. When an error message is seen in the console, check which data file was running, then manually **Delete** all containers in docker desktop and **restart** both applications. Last, check data files to ensure that no intermediate files (.tar extension) were left behind.  
  
The most common error is a connectivity timeout error, this may occur when the computer logs out or enters sleep mode partway through a run. This issue becomes more frequent when Docker Desktop is not restarted between runs.   
  
Two docker containers with the same name can not be run at the same time, ensure that all files have unique names and no docker containers are running or stopped before starting an experiment (these must be deleted).

**Recovering Data**  
When a docker container exits on its own, its experiment was completed successfully. When left running indefinitely, it has failed.
To retrieve any data from partial runs, see the message console to find the location or "Working Directory" of the run. Data is deleted upon exit of the application and must be retrieved before then.  
  
 **Docker Setup on Windows**  
Docker requires WSL2 to be enabled. This should be automatically enabled, is not enter "Settings", then on the "General" page, select the box titled "Use the WSL 2 based engine". Then select "Apply and Restart".
