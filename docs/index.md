This dashboard is designed to facilitate the numerous steps required to run analysis tools required for Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Analysis. 

## How to install

Describe how to install this on your local machine.

## Prepare to run
You will need a series of files to start. 

## Build your workflow

There are generally three types of workflows to run:

### DTIMS single field
Drift tube ion mobility mass spectrometry requires knowledge of experiments and a table of calibration ions.

### SLIM data (also single field)
Data from the SLIM machine.

### DTIMS stepped field
Drift tube ion mobiology mass spectrometry that requires specific known targets and their masses.
Each mode has separate needs for input files, but runs a combination of the modules depicted below.
